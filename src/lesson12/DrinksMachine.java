         * Tools used:
         * 1) enums (drinks)
         * 2) constants (prices)
         * 3) static (total cost)
         * 4) switch (drink selection)
         * Exercise:
         * #1 make an enum DrinksMachine that can make COFFEE, TEA, LEMONADE, MOJITO, MINERAL, COCA_COLA;
         * #2 Make a class Drinks, where constants set the price of a drink;
         * #3 Calculate the number of drinks produced and the total amount the customer has to pay;
         * #4 Make a method for preparing each drink;
         * #5 Make a switch-case statement that will make a drink (by calling the appropriate method) depending on the choice of the client;
         * #6 Add the ability to select a drink for the user, and depending on the choice, make him a drink;
         * #7 The user should be able to order multiple drinks and at the end see how much money they have to pay;
